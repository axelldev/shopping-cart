# Shopping Cart React

A simple app for handling filters and context using React.
This app uses the useContext hook and useReducer as the main purpose of this practice.
It consists of a list of products and 2 filters: a filter for the minimum price and another filter
to select a category of products. These filters are managed with a custom hook and provided to the app
using a context.

Additionally, this app can store a shopping cart for the products, which is handled by using React context
and the useReducer hook. The cart data is also stored in the localStorage to persist the current cart
changes.
